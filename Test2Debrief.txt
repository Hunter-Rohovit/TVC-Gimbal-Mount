Another successful test of the TVC mount without any critical errors involved. TVC mount didn't break this time as a result of increased strength from PETG and widened hinges. Ejection vents worked flawlessly and electronics shield prevented any flames from reaching the electronics beneath it. TVC mount struggled to stay vertical when it was supposed to. Lots of sporadic movement, mostly with the outer servo. The four corner gimbal worked very well (much better than I had anticipated). The TVC mount appeared to be more in control during gimbaling movements rather than during static positions. The force from the thrust didn't affect the servos ability to move the motor holder in both directions. The total impulse (8.54 N-s) was significantly lower than the expected impulse of 10 N-s. However, it was similar to the previous test of 8.76 N-s. I didn't recalibrate the load cells to see if the calibration factors were truly the issue. However, considering both tests had similar total impulse that were both lower than expected yield, I am confident that the load cells just need to be recalibrated. 

Looking at the Thrust vs. time graph, we can see the 80hz load cells provided a much cleaner and more detailed graph than the 10hz load cells (obviously 8 times the amount of data would do this). This time max thrust was 11.175N which is more than the previous test's. However, because the last test was recorded at 10hz it is likely the true max wasn't recorded in the data. After the initial peak thrust, there is constant thrust at around 4N for the next 1.6 seconds. Once again, this graph matches up with the manufacturer's data. 

Looking at the scatterplot, we can visibly see that the TVC mount was less controllable during this test. The max Y-range was 67.5cm, which is definitely a recording error as the max it can be is 14cm. More analysis of the data is needed to get rid of outlier data. The range in the X-direction was 6cm which is reasonable. The excessively large range in the y-direction shows the lack of control with the outer loop. Considering the servo pulls on the inner loop with a larger lever arm, the servo has to move significantly less to move the mount the same number degrees as compared with the inner servo which pulls directly on the motor holder. 

Considering the changes that were made with test 2 and the sporadic movement of the servos that wasn't seen with test 1, it is safe to say the movement has to do with changing the HX711 boards from 10hz to 80hz. These boards pull significantly more current than they did in test 1 leaving the servos with insufficient power. I attempted to resolve this issues in multiple ways. The first was adding a power supply solely for powering the servos. This improved the servos' ability to gimbal, but it didn't prevent the sporadic movement during static holds. (I made sure to connect the power supply's ground to the Arduino's ground, so as to have a common ground) The next idea I had was to connect a 1000uF capacitor in parallel with the servos' power and ground wires. I figured the capacitor's ability to store charge would help smooth the current creating a more stable TVC mount, but nothing changed after implementing this. I tried replacing the motors, which did help a little bit, but not much. I also made sure the 9V batteries that were used were full, but that also had little effect. In conclusion, I am not sure how to move forward with making the TVC mount more stable. But, I'm fairly confident it is a power distribution issue rather than a mechanical or coding error. 

Changes for test 3: 
-recalibrated load cells 
-Smaller hole size for outer servo link
-less stripped outer hinge
