# TVC-Gimbal-Mount
The TVC Gimbal Mount is an ongoing project with the eventual goal of creating a model rocket entirely controlled by TVC. This project was inspired by Joe Barnard @BPS.space, who attempted to land a model rocket using TVC. As for right now, the only goal is to achieve vertical controlled liftoff. The gimbal mount is designed using Autodesk Fusion360 to be 3D printed in three main pieces (outer layer, inner layer, motor casing). The current version is capable of 10 degrees of freedom. While designing an effective TVC mount is the main goal of the project, I am also gaining valuable experience with collecting data and performing data analysis on Static Fire tests. Most of the data being collected is thrust-force produced by the solid rocket motors through the use of load cells and HX711 amplifiers. This project ultimately is a culmination of all the skills I have learned so far and is purely my design: CAD, Arduino, Python.
