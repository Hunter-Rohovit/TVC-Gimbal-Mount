Conducted this test with an immobile TVC mount. No servos or electronics were connected during this test in case of anomaly with the ejection vents. First iteration of vents worked exactly as intended. Engine did not fly out of motor holder this time as was the case with the last test. Flames were directed sideways for the most part. However, flames seemed to crawl along the the static fire mount. To ensure no electronics are burned or fried for the next test, a protection shield will be put in place.
